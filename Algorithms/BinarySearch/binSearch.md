# Binary Search Summary

- halve the space over which we search
- at each halving, elimiate 1/2 of remaining possibilities
- max number of steps required is O(logn)

# Precondition
- must be presorted from least to highest

# How to implement binary search:
I included code to implement a binary search on an int array in Java. 
```sh
javac binSearch.java
java binSearch
```

# Performance of Binary Search
