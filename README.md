# Data Structures and Algorithms

I am creating a repo of all of the data structures and algorithms knowledge that I have gathered from online resources and my classes, specifically:

  - COEN 12 Data Structures and Algorithms
  - COEN 79 Object-Oriented Programming
  - COEN 179 Theory of Algorithms
  - COEN 379 Advanced Design and Analysis of Algorithms

# Languages

  - Java
  - C
  - C++
  - Python
> I am creating a user interface that will allow the user to input:
 - Language
 - Function 
> and outputs:
- Sorting algorithm
- Worst case run-time
- Best case run-time
- Average run-time

You can also:
  - Search through each marked folder for notes on code to implement each data structure/algorithm; and
  - View various course notes that I will include
  - Compare data structures per language against each other
    > determine what data structure to use when optimizing:
    - memory allocation
    - size
    - memory efficiency
    - execution time

# User Interface Features

1. Users can get worst case/best case for running (insert algorithm) on a (insert data structure)
2. Users can retrieve the code for a series of combinations:
  - (insert language) , (insert algorithm), (insert data structure)
  - (insert language), (insert data structure)
